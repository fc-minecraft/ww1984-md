# Dance Floor
The colors on the wall seem to match the colors on the floor. Help Wonder Woman move over the colored blocks in the same sequence as seen on the wall. That should unlock a secret door on the back wall.

**Blocks Available:**  
*Move <direction> by <number>* - Wonder Woman will move in that direction the specified number of blocks.  
*repeat <number> times* - Repeat code the specified number of times.  

```ghost
ww.moveWW(Direction.Forward, 0)
```
```package
minecraft-ww1984=github:ReWrite-Media/ww1984-ts
```
